.SH DESCRIPTION
List WNPP bugs about packages that have specific debtags, ordered by the
number of installations reported by popcon. For every matching bug, list the
bug type, the bug name, the package it refers to, its popcon installations,
and if applicable, the bug's "dust" (ie, how many days since the bug was last
altered).

By default, wnpp-by-tags searches against the following kinds of bugs:
orphaned (O), help requested (RFH), being adopted (BA), and request for
