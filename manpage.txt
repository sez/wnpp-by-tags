[description]
List WNPP bugs about packages that have specific debtags, ordered by the
number of installations reported by popcon. For every matching bug, list the
bug type, the bug name, the package it refers to, its popcon installations,
and if applicable, the bug's "dust" (ie, how many days since the bug was last
altered).

By default, wnpp-by-tags searches against the following kinds of bugs:
orphaned (O), help requested (RFH), being adopted (BA), and request for
adoption (RFA).

[configuration file]
Some options can be overriden in ~/.wnpptagsrc:
.PP
\fIbugs_update_period_in_days\fR (default: \fI30\fR)
.RS 4
keep bug data for this many days before re-downloading them
.RE
.PP
\fIpopcon_update_period_in_days\fR (default: \fI7\fR)
.RS 4
similarly for popcon data
.RE
.PP
\fIbeing_adopted_threshold_in_days\fR (default: \fI150\fR)
.RS 4
consider packages that are "being adopted" for at least this many days as not
actively being worked on
.RE
.PP
\fIbug_types_to_query\fR (default: \fIorphaned, help_requested, being_adopted, rfa_bypackage\fR)
.RS 4
comma-separated list of bug types to query against
.RE
.PP
Every line in the configuration file should be in the form "parameter =
value". Lines starting with the sharp sign are ignored.
